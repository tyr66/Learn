## 控制器和适配器的区别

*摘自深入理解计算机操作系统 第三版 1.41*

```
Each I/O device is connected to the I/O bus by either a controller or an adapter. The distinction between the two is mainly one of packaging. Controllers are chip sets in the device itself or on the system’s main printed circuit board (often called the motherboard). An adapter is a card that plugs into a slot on the motherboard.Regardless, the purpose of each is to transfer information back and forth between the I/O bus and an I/O device
