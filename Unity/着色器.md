## 禁止Unity编辑器的异步着色器编译

```
asynchronous shader compilation. This is a feature of the Unity editor, not builds. The editor only compiles shaders when needed, instead of ahead of time. This can save a lot of compilation time when editing shaders, but means that a shader isn't always immediately available. When this happens a uniform cyan dummy shader is temporarily used instead until the shader compilation process has finishes, which runs in parallel. This is usually fine, but the dummy shader doesn't work with procedural drawing. It will significantly slow down the drawing process. If this happens when trying to render a million points it will most likely freeze and then crash Unity, and possibly your entire machine along with it.
```

可以在着色器脚本中使用 `#pragma editor_sync_compilation` 预处理指令来强制Unity让该着色器脚本在首次使用前被加载和编译。
